38. Evaluate a student's total marks across various examinations and determine their grade. The grading criteria are as follows:
    - If the total marks fall within the range of 89 to 100 (inclusive), the student receives an A+ grade.
    - If the examination is labeled as "Final-exam," the student will receive an A+ grade only if their total marks are 90 or greater. Assume that final examination means we pass 'true' as second parameter otherwise blank.
    - If the student achieves an A+ grade, the program should return 'true'; otherwise, it should return 'false'.
