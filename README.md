2. Print the current window contents.
3. Get the current date.
4. Find the area of a triangle where three sides are 5, 6, 7.
5. Rotate the string 'w3resource' in the right direction. This is done by periodically removing one letter from the string end and attaching it to the front.
6. Determine whether a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.
7. Find out if 1st January will be a Sunday between 2014 and 2050.
8. Write a program where the program takes a random integer between 1 and 10, and the user is then prompted to input a guess number. The program displays a message "Good Work" if the input matches the guess number otherwise "Not matched".
9. Calculate the days left before Christmas.
10. Calculate multiplication and division of two numbers (input from the user).
11. Convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit. Formula: c/5 = (f-32)/9 (where c = temperature in Celsius and f = temperature in Fahrenheit)
12. Get the website URL (loading page).
13. Create a variable using a user-defined name.
14. Get the filename extension.
15. Get the difference between a given number and 13, if the number is broader than 13 return double the absolute difference.
16. Compute the sum of the two given integers. If the two values are the same, then return triple their sum.
17. Compute the absolute difference between a specified number and 19. Returns triple the absolute difference if the specified number is greater than 19.
18. Check a pair of numbers and return true if one of the numbers is 50 or if their sum is 50.
19. Check whether a given integer is within 20 of 100 or 400.
20. Check two given integers whether one is positive and another one is negative.
21. Create another string by adding "Py" in front of a given string. If the given string begins with "Py" return the original string.
22. Remove a character at the specified position in a given string and return the modified string.
23. Create a new string from a given string by changing the position of the first and last characters. The string length must be broader than or equal to 1.
24. Create another string from a given string with the first character of the given string added to the front and back.
25. Check whether a given positive number is a multiple of 3 or 7.
26. Create a string from a given string. This is done by taking the last 3 characters and adding them at both the front and back. The string length must be 3 or more.
27. Check whether a string starts with 'Java' if it does not otherwise.
28. Check whether two given integer values are in the range 50..99 (inclusive). Return true if either of them falls within the range.
29. Check whether three given integer values are in the range 50..99 (inclusive). Return true if one or more of them are in the specified range.
30. Check whether a string " Script" appears at the 5th (index 4) position in a given string. If "Script" appears in the string, return the string without "Script" otherwise return the original one.
31. Find the largest of three given integers.
32. Find the closest value to 100 from two numerical values.
33. Check whether two numbers are in the range 40..60 or 70..100 inclusive.
34. Find the largest number from the two given positive integers. The two numbers are in the range 40..60 inclusive.
35. Check whether a specified character exists between the 2nd and 4th positions in a given string.
36. Check whether the last digit of three positive integers is the same.
37. Produce a new string that has the first 3 characters in lower case from a given string. If the string length is less than 3 convert all the characters to upper case.
38. Evaluate a student's total marks across various examinations and determine their grade. The grading criteria are as follows:
    - If the total marks fall within the range of 89 to 100 (inclusive), the student receives an A+ grade.
    - If the examination is labeled as "Final-exam," the student will receive an A+ grade only if their total marks are 90 or greater. Assume that final examination means we pass 'true' as second parameter otherwise blank.
    - If the student achieves an A+ grade, the program should return 'true'; otherwise, it should return 'false'.
39. Compute the sum of the two given integers. If the sum is in the range 50..80 return 65 otherwise return 80.
40. Check from two given integers whether one of them is 8 or their sum or difference is 8.
41. Check a set of three numbers; if the three numbers are the same return 30; otherwise return 20; and if two numbers are the same return 40.
42. Check whether three given numbers are increasing in strict or in soft mode:
    > Strict mode: 10, 15, 31
    > Soft mode: 24, 22, 31 or 22, 22, 31
43. Check from three given numbers (non negative integers) that two or all of them have the same rightmost digit.
44. Evaluate three given integers to determine if any one of them is greater than or equal to 20 and less than at least one of the other two.
45. Check two integer values and returns true if either one is 15 or if their sum or difference is 15.
46. Check two given non-negative integers if one (not both) is a multiple of 7 or 11.
47. Check whether a given number exists in the range 40..10000. For example 40 presents in 40 and 4000
48. Reverse a given string.
49. Replace every character in a given string with the character following it in the alphabet.
50. Capitalize the first letter of each word in a given string.
